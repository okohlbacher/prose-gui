#   Windows  bin/ProSE.exe, bin/*.dll the closure beside the exe (Windows has no RPATH; the exe's folder
#                                     is searched first), with the Visual C++ runtime and vcomp140 (the one

  # (bin/../share/OpenMS, the bundle's), and the OPENMS_DATA_PATH variable comes last of all (File.cpp,
  # resolveOpenMSDataPath_). So setting the variable cannot steer a bundled tool; what has to be ruled out is
  # that one of the compiled-in paths exists on the user's machine:
  # - the install prefix (OPENMS_INSTALL_DATA_PATH, /usr/local/share/OpenMS): a user may well have an
  #   OpenMS of another version installed there. The bundle's copy of that string is overwritten in place
  #   with a path of the same length that cannot exist ("/dev/null////..."), as relocating packagers
  #   (conda) rewrite the prefix; OpenMS reads it through a volatile pointer for exactly this reason
  #   (installPath_), so the string in .rodata is the one used.
  # - the source and build tree (OPENMS_DATA_PATH, OPENMS_BINARY_PATH for the PeptDeep models, the tool
  #   registry): paths of the build machine (in CI below /home/runner/work), which do not exist on a
  #   user's machine. GCC writes these strings into the code as immediates, so they cannot be patched;
  #   smoke-appimage.sh --hide-openms hides them on the build machine to test the bundle as a user's
  #   machine sees it.

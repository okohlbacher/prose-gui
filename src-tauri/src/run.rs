//! Running a search: the search folder, the process, its progress, and cancel.
//!
//! A search lives in `<searches>/<id>.partial/` while it runs. Beside the tool's outputs it holds
//!
//! - the inputs as links `<n>__<name>` to the user's files (never copies) and `inputs.json`, the
//!   mapping from link to the user's path (see [`crate::args::InputRecord`]). On Windows, where a
//!   symbolic link needs a privilege, ProSE gets the user's paths themselves when the inputs' names
//!   differ, and hard links only for inputs that share a name, removed again when the search ends
//!   ([`crate::args::InputLinks`]);
//! - `database.fasta`, the user's FASTA with the contaminants, if they were asked for;
//! - `prose.log`, the tool's output.
//!
//! The folder holds `.lock`, locked exclusively (`history::lock_partial`) for as long as the search
//! lives, so that the startup sweep of any app instance can tell a live folder from a stale one.
//!
//! On success the folder is renamed to `<searches>/<id>/` and `done` is sent; on failure or cancel it is
//! removed (a failure sends `failed`, a cancel nothing: `cancel` returns when the process is gone). The
//! log of a failed search is kept, as `<app data>/logs/last-failure.log` ([`LAST_FAILURE_LOG`]; the
//! searches folder's sibling), replacing the one before.
//!
//! The tool runs in a process group of its own, started from a thread of its own that waits for it.
//! Cancel signals the group (SIGTERM, then SIGKILL after a grace period), and the group is swept with
//! SIGKILL after the tool has ended, so nothing it started outlives it. If the app dies:
//! - Linux: the tool gets SIGKILL (`PR_SET_PDEATHSIG`; the thread that starts it lives as long as it runs);
//! - Windows: the group is a job object, closed with the app, which ends whatever is still in it (cancel
//!   terminates the job: Windows has no SIGTERM for a console tool);
//! - macOS has no death signal: a watchdog process per search (the app's own executable, started with
//!   `--watch-search`: [`crate::watchdog`]) ends the tool's group within a second of the app's end. Without
//!   it (it could not be started) the tool would end at its next write to stdout or stderr, whose reading
//!   ends died with the app (SIGPIPE, at its default in the child: `Command` resets it, and OpenMS sets no
//!   handler), at the end of its current step; a later start of the app sweeps the folder.

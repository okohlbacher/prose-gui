//! History: the searches of the app's data folder (`<searches>/<id>/`), and the project files.
//!
//! A search is in History when its folder has `search.json` (the record: see `src/lib/history/history.ts`
//! for its schema, version 1). The app writes the record right after `search://done`, before it reads the
//! results ([`save_record`]), and `proteins.fasta` once it has read them ([`save_proteins`], which also
//! drops the folder's `database.fasta`); from then on Rust owns the folder: [`list`], [`rename`],
//! [`delete`], and [`import`], which makes a folder of a project file's entries. A finished folder
//! without a record (the app ended, or the record could not be written, as the search finished) is
//! listed with an `error`, so that it can be deleted, as is a folder with an unreadable or unknown record;
//! none fails the list. [`sweep`] (at startup) removes only the partial folders of interrupted searches:
//! a finished search is never removed but by the user.
//!
//! A `<id>.partial` folder (a running search or import) holds `.lock`, locked exclusively by its owner
//! ([`lock_partial`]) until the folder is renamed or removed; the sweep removes a partial folder only
//! when it can take that lock itself (an owner that died has released it), so no app instance sweeps a
//! live folder of another.
//!
//! A project file (`.prose`) is a zip of the search folder's regular files. Zip is handled by the
//! front end; Rust reads the chosen file (`open_project_file`, with [`read_chosen_project`]) and writes the entries the front end
//! sends ([`import`], in the framing of [`frame`]), after checking every path again.

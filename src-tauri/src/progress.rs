//! the ones that mark a step into `{label, file, fraction}`, the shape of the web app's progress
//! (`progressMapper`, `app/src/lib/engine/core.ts`), with the web app's labels where it has one.

//!
//! | ProSE line (stdout)                                                       | position in the file's share |

//! | `-qpx_extended: selecting the NCE of <path> with PeptDeep rescoring ...`  | 0.26                         |
//! | `Progress of 'Predicting fragment intensities ...` (of that selection)    | 0.43                         |

//!
//! The label is `Preparing the spectrum view (file i of n)...` (one input: `Preparing the spectrum view...`),
//! file -1. The input of a line is its link `<n>__<name>` in the path (else the user's name in it); a line of
//! an earlier input than the current one moves nothing. The positions are those of the iPRG2015 run below
//! (per input: reading the spectra again 11 s, selecting the NCE 7 s plus its predictions 10 s, the PSMs'
//! predictions and the mz view 14 s).
//!
//! # The bar
//!
//! The files' search takes [0, 0.35] of the bar (file i of n the part [i/n, (i+1)/n] of it; in a chunked
//! search the chunks the first half of it and the files' rescoring the rest), the spectrum views
//! [0.35, 0.95] (each input an equal part), the pooled protein inference and FDR of several files
//! (`[ProSE] Protein inference on …`, before OpenMS #10707 `[ProSE] Merged protein inference …`:
//! `Pooling the files...`) 0.95, and the search report (`Writing the results...`) 0.97. Measured with the
//! iPRG2015 runs (16 threads, the yeast database with contaminants, AppImage with ONNX Runtime), the part after
//! the files' search is: with the default settings (PeptDeep off, so each input's NCE is selected) 87 % of the
//! run for three inputs (18 s of 144 s searching), 71 % for one input (7 s of 24 s), 73 % with co-isolated
//! precursors (16 s of 59 s); with PeptDeep on 49–51 % (one input 29 s of 56 s, three 71 s of 145 s). A larger
//! database or a semi-specific search lengthens the search only, so the files get 35 %. The positions are
//! estimates of where in a file's work a step sits, not measurements. Whatever the mode, a line that is not in
//! the tables gives no event, the fraction never goes back, and once the spectrum views began no line of the
//! files' search is reported again.
